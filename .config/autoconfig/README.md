## pics

For liscencing reasons I am not including the background picture so you will have to find one yourself, put it in a `pictures` directory and name it `original.jpg`

## How to use

You can copy the files directly to use the configuration. However you have to use the ones in the 'temp' folder, else the configs won't be valid. And you will have to place them to the correct emplacement yourself.  
The point of this project is to automate rice modification, so you can simply change the settings in the templates (in 'configs') and then modify some variables in 'autoconfig.fish' and then run the fish script to apply the colors globally and place them to the right place for you.
